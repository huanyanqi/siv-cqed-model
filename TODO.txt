- Cavity QED learning task
    ○ Read more about modelling this - e.g. Waks/Vuckovic
    ○ Task: Couple a generic 2-level system into a cavity, compute spectrum (in reflection etc.)
    ○ Make a writeup about the Hamiltionian and theory of how this works
- Parameters to be fit from spectrum:
    ○ Bare cavity parameters: Width of cavity (from laser scan)
    ○ SiV parameters: g, Gamma, kappa_wg, kappa_outside (from reflection spectrum with SiV)
- Extensions:
    ○ More than 2-level system, becomes non-linear
    ○ Depend on spin-state, pumping between levels
    ○ Maybe can merge it with the SiV modeling class for combined scans
